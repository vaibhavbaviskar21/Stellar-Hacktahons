3. Try to verify the MODIFIED document
4. Upload modified version

**Expected Results:**
- ‚ùå **TAMPERING DETECTED** (red banner)
- ‚ùå Error: "Document hash doesn't match"
- ‚ùå Transaction blocked
- üîí Message: "File may have been modified"

**This proves the system works!** Any change to the document is detected.

### üéØ Scenario 6: Verification History

**Steps:**
1. Go to `/dashboard/verification-history`
2. View all verification records
3. Filter by "Verified" status
4. Search for a specific wallet address
5. Click **"View Verifier"** or **"View Candidate"**

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ All verification records displayed
- ‚úÖ Shows candidate/verifier addresses
- ‚úÖ Document hashes visible
- ‚úÖ Timestamps accurate
- ‚úÖ Status badges (Verified/Rejected)
- ‚úÖ Links to Stellar Explorer work
